# Helper functions

Abstracting out common script operations.

## Scripts

### find-script-dir

A script may be run from anywhere but may rely on includes whose locations are only known
relative to its own location, such as `scriptdir/includes/file.inc`. Sourcing the latter
within `scriptdir/script` could be done na√Øvely with the line `. includes/file.inc`, but
this will generally fail unless the script is run from within the directory `scriptdir`.

Solution: Add the following two line inside the sourcing script:

```bash
SCRIPTDIR=$(find-script-dir ${BASH_SOURCE[0]})
. "$SCRIPTDIR/includes/file.inc"
```

### make-index-file

A directory may contain an indeterminate number of files to source. Rather than rediscovering
them every time, create an index file that sources them all.

```bash
# dir contains f1.bashrc and f2.bashrc
make-index-file dir
# creates dir/index.bashrc with content:
# . dir/f1.bashrc
# . dir/f2.bashrc
```
